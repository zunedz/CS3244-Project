# CS3244 Project - HUMAN ACTIVITY AND POSTURAL TRANSITIONS RECOGNITION

## Motivation
Utilize this human activity dataset to detect individualsâ€™ actions real time and estimate the calories burnt so as to make necessary changes.

## Dataset description
dataset consists of accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals readings from user smartphones that are placed in their waist while performing these 12 activities (6 basic activities: standing, sitting lying, walking, walking downstairs and walking upstairs and 6 postural transitions: stand-to-sit, sit-to-stand, sit-to-lie, lie-to-sit, stand-to-lie, lie-to-stand). The dataset has been pre-processed and converted from time series data into tabular data with 516 features and ~10.000 rows.
